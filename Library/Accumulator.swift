 A generator that creates a multi-call closure which returns an accumulation of values over time

 :param: initial The starting value for the accumulator.
 :param: incrementBy The value that should be addded to initial when the closure is called.

 :returns: A closure that when called returns the initial with the incrementBy param mutliplied.
